- Which methods did you decide to `overload`, and why?

I overloaded all the constructors becuase it is easy and means I don't have to type a bunch of parameters later to construct things. I overloaded goToFloor because it would be nice to have a default for that. For the cafe I overloaded restock since sometimes you don't want to have to specify how much more coffee you want. 


- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?


The interfaces broke on this one so I just didn't implent them. I don't know if it was due to anything in the code or just because I had to reinstall Java because my computer broke last week.
